@workspace i don't think the nodemon.sjon file shoul dbe commited to github. do you?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me examine the `nodemon.json` file to understand its contents and determine if it should be committed to Git. Let me also check if there's already a `.gitignore` file in the project: Based on my examination of the `nodemon.json` file, I believe it **should** be committed to GitHub. Here's why:

1. **Configuration, not secrets**: The `nodemon.json` file contains only development configuration settings:
   - Which directories to watch (`src`)
   - Which file extensions to monitor (`ts,json`)
   - Which files to ignore (`*.spec.ts`)
   - The command to execute (`tsx src/index.ts`)

2. **Team consistency**: This configuration ensures that all developers on the project have the same nodemon behavior when running the development server.

3. **No sensitive data**: There are no environment variables, API keys, or other sensitive information in this file.

4. **Standard practice**: It's common practice to commit configuration files like `nodemon.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, etc., as they define how the project should be built and run.

The file is already properly excluded from your `.gitignore` patterns since it doesn't match any of the ignored patterns. Configuration files like this are typically committed so that:

- New team members can easily set up the development environment
- Everyone uses the same development configuration
- The project can be consistently built and run across different machines

So no, you don't need to add `nodemon.json` to your `.gitignore` file. It should remain committed to the repository.

@workspace teach me about biome.json files and help me write one that is needed for this project

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me first examine your project structure to understand what kind of biome configuration would be most appropriate, then I'll teach you about `biome.json` and help you create one. Now let me check if Biome is already installed in your project: Perfect! Let me teach you about **Biome** and help you set it up for your TypeScript blog project.

## What is Biome?

**Biome** is a modern, fast toolchain for web development that combines:
- **Linting** (like ESLint)
- **Formatting** (like Prettier) 
- **Import sorting**
- **Type checking assistance**

It's written in Rust, making it extremely fast, and it's designed to replace multiple tools with a single, cohesive solution.

## Key Benefits:
1. **Speed**: Much faster than ESLint + Prettier combination
2. **Zero config**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
3. **Consistent**: Same rules for linting and formatting
4. **Modern**: Built specifically for modern JavaScript/TypeScript projects

## Your Project Analysis:
- Backend: TypeScript with Fastify
- Frontend: Appears to be a Vite-based project (empty but structured)
- You're using modern ES modules (`"type": "module"`)

Let me create a comprehensive `biome.json` configuration for your project: 
````

````
Let me fix that linting rule error: 
```

```
Now let me show you how to install and use Biome. First, let's add it to your backend project: Now let's add useful scripts to your backend package.json: 
```

```
Let's test Biome on your current code: I need to update the `biome.json` file to match the newer version. Let me fix this:
